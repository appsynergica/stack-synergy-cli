Urban Shona is a mono-repository that aims to stream line the process of creating MyEAN Stack Web Applications. The repository will incrementally contain the following tools:    
          
- [Browsifier](https://github.com/urbanshona/urbanshona/tree/master/packages/browsifier) :  A Command Line Application for generating Typescript classes without decorators from TypeORM Entity definitions. This solves a problem where TypeORM Entities cannot be imported into browser apps Like Angular Applications because they use webpack which bundles things and TypeORM doesn't work well with bundling.      
      
- [Graphqlsifier](https://github.com/urbanshona/urbanshona/tree/master/packages/graphqlsifier) : A Command Line App for adding "code first" nestjs graphql decorators and or class validator decorators to TypeORM entities.         
       
- [Generator](https://github.com/urbanshona/urbanshona/tree/master/packages/generator): A Command Line Interface for generating NestJS Feature Modules from a set of templates in a specified folder. The generated NestJS Feature Module folder will contain a service, service.spec, module, controller or controller.spec fully populated with broiler plate code that matches the logic of other similar feature modules located in the application.        
      
- [Urbanshona App](https://github.com/urbanshona/urbanshona/tree/master/packages/urbanshona): A  customizable full stack server side rendered MySQL - Angular - NestJS Application that inherently has features like : User Authentication, Role Based Access Control, Attribute Based Access Control, GraphQL, REST, Input Validation, Fast Database Modeling, Database Seeding / Migration, fast TypeORM entity Generation, File Management - Local / Cloud Based, Emailing and so much more, Payment Gateways, SEO Management and so much more
